## üßÆ **DAX Measures**

```dax
Average Profit = AVERAGE('Sales'[Profit])
Defective Product = SUM('Sales'[Defective Units])
Mfg cost = SUM('Manufacturing'[Cost])
Total Cost = [Mfg cost] + [transportation cost]
Total Product Available = SUM('Inventory'[Available Units])
total Product Produced = SUM('Production'[Produced Units])
Total Product Sold = SUM('Sales'[Sold Units])
Total Profit = SUM('Sales'[Profit])
Total Revenue = SUM('Sales'[Revenue])
total Stock = SUM('Inventory'[Stock Units])
transportation cost = SUM('Transport'[Cost])
